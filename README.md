# Haskbot

A Haskell-based Slack chatbot using the Happstack framework.

## Why Haskell?

Because it fucking rocks.

While I am currently too low on the academic food-chain to understand category
theory or abstract algebra, I'm more than happy to reap the benefits.

## Why Haskbot?

So that I can maliciously force Haskell upon my coworkers at
[Bendyworks](http://bendyworks.com) by creating a useful tool in my most
favorite of languages.

## Contributing

I'm totally in over my head, so if you'd like to improve upon my codebase,
please do!
